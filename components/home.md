# Free Read and Write API Access to Google Sheets
  
Use this free service to convert your Google Sheets into a simple REST API. To ensure absolute privacy, host the [open source software](https://github.com/gcleaves/sheet-api-be) yourself.

There are plenty of alternatives to this software, however few of them 
give you unlimited usage and include the ability to update and search 
Google Sheets. Commercial services do provide update ability, 
but you must hand over complete access to all your Google Sheets 
to a complete stranger.
