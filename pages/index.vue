  <p>Use this free service to convert your Google Sheets into a simple REST API.
    To ensure absolute privacy, host the <a href="https://github.com/gcleaves/sheet-api-be">open source software</a>
    yourself.
  </p>
  <p>There are plenty of alternatives to this software, however few of them give you unlimited usage and
    include the ability to update and search Google Sheets. Commercial services do provide update ability,
    but you must hand over complete access to all your Google Sheets to a complete stranger.
